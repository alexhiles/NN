# Implementation of an artificial neural network
General artificial neural network (ANN) implemented in Python.

Currently implemented:
- Naive Implementation based on work in the [paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/18M1165748).

In Progress:

- General Implementation of arbitrary neurons and arbitrary layers for a
classification problem involving noughts and crosses.
